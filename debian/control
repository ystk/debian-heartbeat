Description: Subsystem for High-Availability Linux
 heartbeat is a basic heartbeat subsystem for Linux-HA which implements
 serial, UDP, and PPP/UDP heartbeats together with IP address takeover
 including a nice resource model including resource groups.
 .
 It currently supports a very sophisticated dependency model for n-node
 clusters. It is both extremely useful and quite stable at this point in
 time.

 This package contains the Heartbeat libraries to make them available
 to other programs like Pacemaker without having to install the whole
 Heartbeat suite.
